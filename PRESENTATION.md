Presentation Script — Social Media Analytics Module
Date: February 12, 2026
Duration target: 3–5 minutes

1) Opening (15–20s)
- "This is a modular Social Media Analytics system implemented in Python. It ingests social posts and produces multi-modal analysis (text, emoji, image, audio, video) and visualizations including word clouds and a dashboard."

2) One-line architecture (15–20s)
- "`main.py` orchestrates the workflow; `analyzers/` contains five analyzer modules; `visualizations/` creates charts, word clouds, and a dashboard; `config.py` centralizes paths and settings. Outputs are saved under `social_media_analytics/output/`."

3) Methods & highlights (45–60s)
- Text: VADER + TextBlob combined for robust social-media sentiment; keyword extraction via tokenization and stopword filtering.
- Emoji: character-level emoji extraction with a simple positive/negative mapping for quick signal.
- Image: K-means color clustering + brightness and OpenCV face detection to infer visual mood.
- Audio: Generates simple features and uses speech-to-text when available.
- Video: Key-frame extraction and motion analysis; uses image/audio analyzers for cross-modal insight.
- Visualization: Pygal + Matplotlib for charts; `WordCloudGenerator` produces word clouds; `Dashboard` composes a summary PNG and `full_report.json`.

4) Live demo steps (60–90s)
- Show `README.md` briefly for feature list.
- Show sample input: `social_media_analytics/data/sample_posts.json`.
- Run the pipeline (or show pre-generated outputs):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python social_media_analytics\main.py
explorer .\social_media_analytics\output\wordclouds
explorer .\social_media_analytics\output\reports\full_report.json
```

- Point to these generated artifacts:
  - `output/wordclouds/basic_wordcloud.png`
  - `output/wordclouds/freq_wordcloud.png`
  - `output/wordclouds/hashtag_cloud.png`
  - `output/reports/full_report.json`
  - `output/reports/word_counts.json` (keyword frequencies)

5) Results & validation (20–30s)
- "The demo run processed the sample dataset and produced a JSON report and 15+ visualizations. For accuracy, text sentiment uses both VADER and TextBlob and we inspect disagreements; future work includes labeled data for quantitative evaluation."

6) Reproducibility & deployment (15–20s)
- "Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. There is a `setup_github.ps1` script to initialize git and a `setup_github.py` fallback. The project is pushed to GitHub (repo visible)."

7) Closing & next steps (15–20s)
- "Next steps: scale to larger datasets with batching and multiprocessing, add an annotated test set for evaluation, add CI and a web-deployed dashboard."

FAQ / Q&A (short answers)
- Q: "How accurate is sentiment?"
  A: "Combined VADER+TextBlob gives a robust signal for social text; we plan to add labeled data and compute precision/recall." 

- Q: "How to reproduce results?"
  A: "Install from `requirements.txt`, activate the venv, then run `python social_media_analytics\main.py`. The `README.md` and `GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` explain setup steps."

- Q: "Can it scale?"
  A: "Yes—analyzers are modular; we can parallelize analysis and use a database or cloud storage for large volumes."

- Q: "Where are the word counts?"
  A: "`output/reports/word_counts.json` contains keyword frequencies generated by `TextAnalyzer.extract_keywords()`; word clouds are saved in `output/wordclouds/`."

- Q: "Is this open-source?"
  A: "Yes — MIT license is included. The repo is pushed to GitHub for review."

Handy bullet list for teacher demo (one page)
- Show: `README.md`, `main.py`, `analyzers/text_analyzer.py`, `visualizations/wordcloud_gen.py`, `output/reports/full_report.json`, `output/wordclouds/freq_wordcloud.png`.
- Run: activate venv → `python social_media_analytics\main.py` → open outputs.

Contact & next steps you can propose
- Offer to add a web front-end or CI pipeline, or to run the pipeline on a larger real dataset.
